    "* Topic can be partitioned, for each of the partition there will be directory in the nodes where Kafka broker is running.\n",
    "* Based on the replication factor each directory related to partition will be mirrored to more than one node on which Kafka broker is running.\n",
    "* We can use 3rd party applications such as Kafka Connect, Flume, Logstash etc to publish messages to topic or use Producer API and produce messages using any programming language.\n",
    "* We can use 3rd party applications such as Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, Flume, Spark Streaming etc to consume messages or use Consumer API with any programming language.\n",
    "* One or more producers can produce messages to same topic. We can also develop different producers produce messages to different partitions in the same topic.\n",

    "* org.apache.kafka.clients.producer have APIs related to creating Kafka producer object, defining producer configurations etc\n",
    "* org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer have APIs related to creating Kafka consumer object, defining consumer configurations etc\n",
    "* As we have to write objects into files (Kafka topic) we have to serialize and deserialize\n",
    "* APIs related to serialization and deserialization are available under org.apache.kafka.common package\n",
