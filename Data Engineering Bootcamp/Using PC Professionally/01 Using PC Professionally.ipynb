    "As IT professional or aspirant it is highly desired to use relevant tools. As part of this module we will be touching those important points which can improve your productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This module is relatively small than others.\n",
    "* We will only list the tools and purpose of them.\n",
    "* We will also make recommendations as there are multiple tools to server each of the purpose.\n",
    "* Most of the enterprises will have licenses, you need to check with the team who is responsible in getting you computers and required softwares and get the tools installed.\n",
    "* Some of the tools might not be allowed in the organizations due to security or compliance reasons. Better to avoid them.\n",
    "* It is worth spending time to understand all the features of the tool in detail."
